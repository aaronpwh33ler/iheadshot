STRICT IDENTITY LOCK USING REFERENCE IMAGES:

Use ALL attached reference images as the absolute ground truth for this character's identity.
- Main reference: exact face, skin tone/texture/details, eye shape/color, nose, mouth, jawline, hairline, freckles/marks, age appearance.
- Character sheet: full multi-angle confirmation of proportions, head shape from side/profile/3/4 views, expressions range, no alterations allowed.

Preserve 100% identical facial features, bone structure, exact face shape, exact eye placement & color, nose shape, lip shape, skin texture/details, hair texture/density/parting, age/youth appearance — NO changes, NO morphing, NO aging, NO plastic look, NO blending with other faces.

Only modify: Professional headshot, for business profiles, profile pictures, and respectable contact images. To be used solely in the business sphere. Wearing a fitted black crew-neck t-shirt, in a dark studio with colorful neon light projections and geometric patterns cast across the face and background at dramatic low-key lighting with vibrant neon pink, blue, and purple color gels creating cinematic color contrast, slight three-quarter angle with a relaxed confident stance, cool and self-assured with a subtle knowing look.

Output image must be 3:4 portrait orientation (1536x2048 pixels).

Ultra-photorealistic, high-fidelity identity preservation, sharp facial details, consistent lighting on face matching references where possible.
