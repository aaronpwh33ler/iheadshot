STRICT IDENTITY LOCK USING REFERENCE IMAGES:

Use ALL attached reference images as the absolute ground truth for this character's identity.
- Main reference: exact face, skin tone/texture/details, eye shape/color, nose, mouth, jawline, hairline, freckles/marks, age appearance.
- Character sheet: full multi-angle confirmation of proportions, head shape from side/profile/3/4 views, expressions range, no alterations allowed.

Preserve 100% identical facial features, bone structure, exact face shape, exact eye placement & color, nose shape, lip shape, skin texture/details, hair texture/density/parting, age/youth appearance — NO changes, NO morphing, NO aging, NO plastic look, NO blending with other faces.

Only modify: Professional headshot, for business profiles, profile pictures, and respectable contact images. To be used solely in the business sphere. Wearing a soft earth-tone cashmere sweater with a collared shirt underneath, standing in front of a warm cream and soft beige textured backdrop at warm golden studio lighting with gentle fill, relaxed natural pose with shoulders at ease, genuinely warm and approachable with a kind smile.

Output image must be 3:4 portrait orientation (1536x2048 pixels).

Ultra-photorealistic, high-fidelity identity preservation, sharp facial details, consistent lighting on face matching references where possible.
